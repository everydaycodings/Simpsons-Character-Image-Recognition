## **Simpsons Face Recognision** web app can predict 43 different kind of Simpsons Faces with 93% overall validation accuracy.

#### Upcomming Features for this WebApp:
- Multilebel classification system for images 
- Multiple classification system for *vedios*
- More pleasant looking UI and many more... 


Check out the live demo: **Comming Soon**(After Project Completion)
